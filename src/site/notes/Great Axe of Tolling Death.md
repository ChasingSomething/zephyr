_Rare (requires attunement)_

This greataxe hums with a somber resonance. When casting toll the dead, the blade clangs long a gong.

**Base Weapon:** This weapon functions as a +1 great axe (2d6 slashing, Two-Handed, Heavy, Reach).

- **Toll the Dead:** Toll the Dead (1d4 Chance). When you hit a creature with this weapon, roll a d4. On a 1, the weapon casts Toll the Dead on the target (save ***DC 14***). The effect originates from the weapon.
- The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take necrotic damage. The damage is **1d8 necrotic** if the target has full hit points, or **1d12 necrotic** if the target is missing any hit points.
