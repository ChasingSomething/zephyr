_Rare (requires attunement)_

This polearm is the sinewy arm of the aberration known as the Sordid Eye. Its shaft glistens with a thin film of oil that never dries, and a bulbous, shimmering eye roams restlessly across the weapon, sometimes resting near the haft, sometimes staring out from just below the blade. It never blinks.

**Base Weapon:** This weapon functions as a +1 war scythe (2d6 slashing, Two-Handed, Heavy, Reach).

- **Aberrant Eye-Beam:** When you hit a creature with this weapon, roll a d20. On a 19–20, the eye unleashes a psychic beam. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 2d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.
- **Critical Aberrance:** On a natural 20 attack roll, the eye weeps an oily residue that splashes onto the target’s face. The creature is blinded until it uses an action to wipe away the corruption.

**Curse – The Eye Turns Inward:** If you roll a natural 1 on your d20 attack roll with this weapon, the eye recoils violently, lashing into your mind. You take 1d8 psychic damage. 

**Living Watcher:** The eye constantly shifts its position on the weapon, watching your foes—and sometimes your allies. While attuned, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
