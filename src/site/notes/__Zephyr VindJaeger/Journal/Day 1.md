[[__Zephyr VindJaeger/Journal/Journal\|Journal]] :: [[Day 2\|Day 2]]

Woke up in a cell with a larger Human. Strong. Has a hammer. Seems a little green though. His name is [[People/Rango\|Rango]]. We escaped from the cell and found others in cells nearby; a witch named [[People/Morgan\|Morgan]] and a tiefling. The witch seemed with it, but the tiefling seems a bit touched in the head. 

While rescuing the 2 of them, [[People/Rango\|Rango]] and I activated one of the [[Creatures/Candlelight Guardian\|Candlelight Guardian]]s in the room, though it was rather easily dispatched. [[People/Rango\|Rango]] seems capable enough. We continued on, taking a measured approach to waking and dispatching the other [[Creatures/Candlelight Guardian\|Candlelight Guardian]] in the room. 

Up the stairs we found another cell, containing Barley, an older halfling. He seems to know more about this place. He calls it the [[Places/Stockade of lost souls\|Stockade of lost souls]] - charming.

Something is happening to this place, an earthshattering cacophony as the [[Places/Stockade of lost souls\|stockade]] is nearly ripped in half as we charged up the stairs. Collecting another halfling on the way. A ginger male in odd clothing, calls himself [[People/Tag Heimmer\|Tag]]. 

Upstairs we encountered a few guards, but we were all suddenly overtaken by a swarm of strange worms. I took the opportunity of the distraction to quickly dispatch as many guards as possible. With some help from my fellow captives. 

After dealing with the worms, 2 guards remain, [[People/Bruce\|Bruce]] and [[People/Greg\|Greg]] - both thoroughly shaken. One tried to escape upward with the use of some strange stone floor that moved up and down via the use of a lever. 

I - convinced - the guards to go down instead, to find our gear. 

We encountered a giant spider but that is the least of our worries. There is soemething else down here. Some ungodly huge black tentacles dragged [[People/Greg\|Greg]] down a hallway, After finding our gear and looting the spider's den, we hightailed it out. 

We then found ourselves in a chamber containing several portals. A wee goblin, seems to be the chamber's caretaker. [[Sprok\|Sprok]] he call-himself. 

The silly tiefling ran off into one of them that the goblin labeled 'death' after some more questions about the portals, we took our best guess and charged through a portal. 

---

We emerged on a beach. The portal stood on a stone outcrop near the water. In the distance across the sea, the [[Places/Stockade of lost souls\|stockade]] can be seen crumbling, smoke billowing from its depths. 

There is only one path off the beach. Following it lead to a gate, guarded by a foolish mage, with a [[PointyHat\|PointyHat]]. 

We bypassed the gate but not without learning what we could from [[PointyHat\|PointyHat]]. The nearby town of [[Places/Pinkerton\|Pinkerton]] is where we will take our rest. 

We found an inn, and [[People/Beth\|Beth]] the keep, seems a kind enough soul.  I am starting to doubt the goblin. I know them to be little more than beasts, grunting through their thick words like porridge. This one speaks clearly in the common tongue, but feins idiocy. 'What is a table?' Honestly. He is obviously a spy for our captors. I will await my chance to - remove him from our troupe.

Just before bedding down, I found my opportunity. My strike was true. No goblin could have survived a blade to the neck like that. 

[[Sprok\|Sprok]] was no goblin. My companions gasped, and I shuddered, as the sickening green form began to grow and lighten. A white. Dragon. How could I have known this *thing* was a white dragon. It must have been young, since it fit in the room. But a dragon nonetheless. I thought for sure my temper had finally gotten me in too deep.

But something - strange - happened. As I withdrew my dagger, and readied myself for a fight... it was as if time...slowed. I cannot describe the sensation beyond; clarity. I saw the sharp inhale. Knew what was coming. Had I not seen the opening to roll between the beast's legs, who knows if we'd have survived. I managed several strikes to the things belly, before it attempted to turn on me. Rolling to the side, I barked at [[People/Rango\|Rango]] to ready his hammer. 

The dragon inhaled once again, the hammer launching me nearly through the roof, he connected with its thick leg on the downswing. Just as my knife once again sunk into this creature's throat, only this time it's true throat. It was all over so quickly, it does not seem to have roused any suspicions from the [[People/Beth\|inkeep]] or local guard. 

Looking around at this group I find myself in; I see they are each exhausted. They are not used to being driven as I am. I will let them rest. I nearly cost them all their lives this night. 

What would [[People/Grandmother\|Grandmother]] say? "*Fast wind leaves scorched earth, Skareki‚Äôtha*"

***sigh*** - perhaps my wind does blow too fast. But I have [[People/Vashkara\|Vashkara]] now, I must sit with the wind and listen for its secrets. 

But first - **‚Äú[[__Zephyr VindJaeger/Culture/Language/Language#ü™ì **Phrase to Begin the Kharuun**\|Vakha ne‚Äôkhari, turog ne‚Äôkharuun]]‚Äù**  (Its breath joins the wind, its body joins the herd)
