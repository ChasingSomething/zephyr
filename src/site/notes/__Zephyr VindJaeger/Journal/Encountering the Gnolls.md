_Grandmother, you were right again. And I hate you for it. I hate you for being in my bones, in my rage, in the way the wind whispers when I don’t want to hear it. You said all spirits had their place, that even carrion feeds the grass. But I never thought you meant like this._

_I saw them. Tavos. Mother. My Herd. Their voices barked in mongrel throats, their eyes staring out of hyena skulls. When I raged, when the storm broke through me, the veil dropped. Vashkara bristled, and for once, I could see as she sees. The vom’rakkh were not vom’rakkh at all. They were my blood. My mother sang to me in a gnoll’s tongue. My father called me Cub while holding me in carrion arms. I wept, and I struck, and I almost killed him anyway._

_The warforged told me the truth. The mages twisted his work, binding souls into bodies that do not belong to them. They stuffed the Herd into skins of beasts, mocking their memory. Mocking me. And all this time, I’ve been killing them, thinking I was avenging the dead. What have I done?_

_The Herd breathes, Grandmother. But not as they should. They guard a town now, wearing stolen faces. I don’t know if I should feel relief, or shame, or fury. Maybe all three. Maybe that’s all I’ve ever felt since the massacre._

_The wind knows the way, you said. But tonight it howls. And I don’t know if it howls in mourning, or in warning._
