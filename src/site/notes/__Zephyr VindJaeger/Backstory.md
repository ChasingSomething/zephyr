# **Zephyr, the Wild Little Fox — Backstory Summary**

[[Zephyr-Warpaint.png]]

**Childhood on the Wind Plains**  
Zephyr was born into the nomadic halfling Herd known as _i’Turog_, who roamed the Wind Plains in the Silver Reach. The Herd revered all the elements, but her family line had a special bond with the fox spirit of the wind, Vashkara. Zephyr’s grandmother, the Dreamwalker, was the tribe’s spiritual leader, and everyone expected Zephyr to follow in her path one day.

But Zephyr was mischievous and restless, more drawn to the wilds and the animals than to ritual and study. She often slipped away from chores and lessons to play, hunt, or explore - earning the affectionate nickname _“Skareki’tha”_ (Wild Little Fox). She learned reluctantly, more out of love for her grandmother than duty, but the lessons stuck deeper than she realized.

**The Slaughter of the Herd**  
One day, shirking her responsibilities yet again, Zephyr had wandered off once again, when the gnolls came. By the time she returned, the camp was a massacre: her kin butchered, their remains defiled, her people’s spirit shattered. In grief and fury, she recovered her grandmother’s fox figurine - an heirloom that could summon Vashkara.

When she stumbled upon three gnolls left behind to watch for stragglers, she struck with cunning and rage. The first fell to her blade before it could react; the other two she tore apart in a blind frenzy. That moment hardened her: her roguish mischief was forever tempered by the barbarian’s fury. From then on, she carried a deep, vicious hatred for gnolls  - branding them _vom’rakkh_, carrion-mongrels.

**Captured by the Mages**  
In the years that followed, Zephyr wandered, following the wind’s path  - _“Vekha tor lun, the wind knows the way.”_ Her cunning kept her alive, her rage kept her dangerous, and the fox spirit kept her company.

But her hatred sometimes overwhelmed her judgment. In one town, she came to blows with a gnoll merchant. When she called forth Vashkara in her fury, the strange fox-spirit drew the wrong kind of attention. The mage faction that had been abducting magic users subdued her on the spot.

She woke stripped of her gear in a mage-run prison, where calamity struck just as she met two other captives. They escaped together - and the story of the Herd carried on in Zephyr’s footsteps.
